//Useful commands for GitHub
How to sync from GitHub to computer: use "git clone"
How to sync from computer to GitHub:
-create an empty repository on GitHub
-create a remote repository ("remote") on computer
-->"git remote add remote_name remote_html_source"
(where usually remote_name = origin
and remote_html_source is the HTML source of the GitHub repository)
-use "git push -u remote_name branch_name" to copy branch to GitHub
(ie only and all updated nodes will be copied)
(ie "git push -u origin master")

Reflect: When to Use a Remote Repository
Q.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A.We can use a remote repository to share our work with others in order to collaborate, seek feedback, or show our accomplishments.

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. It might not be useful to be up-to-date with the remote repository on GitHub if you have been editing a same file on your local repository.

Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Q.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. We make a new branch on a repository when we want to make changes to the main code (ie implementing a new feature) and possibly merge that change into the main body of code ("master branch") later, or just make a new version of the code (like an easy version of a game).
If we have a repository on GitHub that we want on our computer, we can make a clone of it from GitHub.
If another person has a repository on GitHub that we want to make our own version of, we can fork it on GitHub.  This is like making a new branch on their repository, but it's all on GitHub.  GitHub copies their repository onto our online profile, then links to their original repository.
